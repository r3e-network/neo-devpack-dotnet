# Checking Latest GitHub Action Failure

Since we fixed the previous build errors, there must be a new issue. 

## To get the latest failure details:

1. **Go to GitHub Actions page:**
   https://github.com/r3e-network/r3e-devpack-dotnet/actions

2. **Click on the latest failed workflow run**

3. **Look for the specific error message**

## Common failure points after build fixes:

### 1. Test Failures
- Look for lines starting with `Failed` or `Error`
- Check if it's the coverage collection issue again
- Look for test timeouts

### 2. Pack Failures
- Missing files referenced in .csproj
- Version conflicts
- Missing dependencies

### 3. Publish Failures
- NUGET secret not set or expired
- Package already exists
- Network issues

### 4. Release Creation Failures
- Missing release files
- GitHub token permissions
- Artifact upload issues

## Please share:
1. Which workflow failed? (release-complete.yml, release-v1.yml, or release-v1-fixed.yml)
2. Which step failed? (build, test, pack, publish, or release)
3. The exact error message

This will help me provide a targeted fix.
