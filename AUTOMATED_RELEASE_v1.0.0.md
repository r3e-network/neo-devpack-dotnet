# Automated Release Process for R3E DevPack v1.0.0

## ðŸš€ Automatic Release Triggered!

Since the v1.0.0 tag has been pushed to GitHub, the following automated processes will now execute:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

The `release-complete.yml` workflow will automatically:

1. **Build & Test** âœ…
   - Build entire solution in Release mode
   - Run all tests (continues even if some fail)

2. **Package Creation** ðŸ“¦
   - Pack all 16 NuGet packages
   - Build platform-specific binaries:
     - Linux x64: `rncc-linux-x64-v1.0.0.tar.gz`
     - Windows x64: `rncc-win-x64-v1.0.0.zip`
     - macOS x64: `rncc-osx-x64-v1.0.0.tar.gz`

3. **NuGet Publishing** ðŸš€
   - Automatically publish all packages to NuGet.org using the NUGET secret
   - Packages published in dependency order
   - Skip duplicates to handle re-runs

4. **GitHub Release** ðŸ“‹
   - Create GitHub release automatically
   - Upload all artifacts:
     - 16 NuGet packages
     - 3 platform binaries
     - Release documentation
   - Set release notes from `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md`

### 2. What Happens Next

1. **Monitor Workflow** 
   - Check: https://github.com/r3e-network/r3e-devpack-dotnet/actions
   - Look for "Complete Release Process" workflow
   - Should take ~10-15 minutes

2. **Verify NuGet Packages**
   - Packages appear at: https://www.nuget.org/profiles/R3E
   - May take 15-30 minutes for indexing

3. **Check GitHub Release**
   - Release page: https://github.com/r3e-network/r3e-devpack-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0
   - All artifacts should be attached

### 3. Manual Steps Still Required

After the automated process completes:

1. **Community Announcements** ðŸ“¢
   - Post in Discord #announcements
   - Tweet the release
   - Update project website
   - Post on Reddit r/NEO

2. **Documentation Updates** ðŸ“š
   - Update docs site with v1.0.0
   - Add tutorials/guides

3. **Monitor Release** ðŸ“Š
   ```bash
   ./monitor-release-v1.0.0.sh
   ```

### 4. Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails:

1. **Check workflow logs**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Find the failed workflow run
   - Check error messages

2. **Common issues:**
   - NuGet API key expired â†’ Update NUGET secret
   - Package already exists â†’ Normal, workflow handles this
   - Build failures â†’ Check recent commits

3. **Manual fallback:**
   ```bash
   # If automated publishing fails
   ./publish-nuget-v1.0.0.sh YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

### 5. Success Indicators

âœ… Workflow completes successfully
âœ… All 16 packages visible on NuGet.org
âœ… GitHub release created with all artifacts
âœ… Users can install: `dotnet tool install -g R3E.Compiler.CSharp.Tool --version 1.0.0`
