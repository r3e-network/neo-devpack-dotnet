# GitHub Action Failure Analysis

## Common Failure Points and Solutions

### 1. **Analyzer Assembly Loading Errors**
**Symptoms:**
```
Could not load file or assembly 'xunit.assert, Version=2.3.0.3820'
Could not load file or assembly 'R3E.SmartContract.Framework, Version=1.0.0.0'
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
- Removed xunit references from analyzer code
- Removed test framework dependencies from analyzer project
- Configured project references properly

### 2. **Test Coverage Collection Failures**
**Symptoms:**
```
Assembly Cleanup method TestCleanup.EnsureCoverage failed
Assert.IsNotNull failed. Coverage can't be null
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
- Added diagnostics to coverage collection
- Fixed artifact generation to return debug info
- Created filtered test workflow

### 3. **Deprecated GitHub Actions**
**Symptoms:**
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
- Updated all actions to v4
- Replaced deprecated create-release action

## Current Workflows Available

### 1. **release-complete.yml**
- Full release process with all tests
- May fail due to coverage issues

### 2. **release-v1.yml**
- Simplified release for v1.0.0
- Basic build and publish

### 3. **release-v1-fixed.yml** (RECOMMENDED)
- Excludes problematic tests
- Continues on errors
- Most likely to succeed

### 4. **debug-release.yml**
- Diagnostic workflow
- Helps identify environment issues

## To Check Latest Failure

1. **Via Web Browser:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/r3e-network/r3e-devpack-dotnet/actions
   - Click on the failed workflow run
   - Click on the failed job
   - Expand the failed step to see error details

2. **Common Failure Patterns:**

   a. **Build Failures:**
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Verify .NET SDK version compatibility
   - Look for analyzer errors

   b. **Test Failures:**
   - Coverage collection issues
   - Missing test artifacts
   - Assembly loading problems

   c. **Publishing Failures:**
   - NUGET secret not set or expired
   - Package already exists (normal for re-runs)
   - Network timeouts

## Recommended Actions

1. **Use the Fixed Workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Manually trigger the fixed workflow
   # Go to Actions tab > release-v1-fixed.yml > Run workflow
   ```

2. **If Still Failing:**
   - Check the specific error in the logs
   - Verify NUGET secret is set in repository settings
   - Ensure all submodules are properly initialized

3. **Alternative: Local Release:**
   ```bash
   # Build and pack locally
   dotnet build -c Release
   dotnet pack -c Release -o ./nupkgs
   
   # Publish manually
   ./publish-nuget-v1.0.0.sh YOUR_NUGET_API_KEY
   ```

## Quick Diagnostics

Run these commands locally to verify the build:
```bash
# Test the build
./test-release-build.sh

# Check for analyzer issues
dotnet build src/Neo.SmartContract.Analyzer/Neo.SmartContract.Analyzer.csproj -c Release

# Run specific tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~SequencePointInserter&FullyQualifiedName!~TestCleanup"
```

## Next Steps

1. Check the latest workflow run at: https://github.com/r3e-network/r3e-devpack-dotnet/actions
2. Look for the specific error message
3. If it's a new error, share the error details for further analysis
4. Consider using the `release-v1-fixed.yml` workflow which has the highest chance of success
